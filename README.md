# Anrich Kruger Vritual CV
As part of our deliverable 1 for CMPG 323 we needed to create a virtual CV. I followed a short tutorial for inspiration on the CV template and made adjustments as needed and where I wanted to add my own creative flair. This virtual CV works on both desktop and mobile devices and is hosted by the GitHub Pages service. As a student who is constantly learning new skills I wil keep updating this CV until I am satisfied with how it represents me as a future software developer.
